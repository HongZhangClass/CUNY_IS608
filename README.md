IS 608 - Knowledge and Visual Analytics
===============

This repository is a store for all materials associated with the CUNY MS Data Analytics Class IS 608 - Knowledge and Visual Analytics. 

If you are a member of the class, I am going to maintain this page indefinitely. I hope that you find it a hepful reference in the future.


### What is git? What is GitHub? ###

Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). It is fantastically complex, but at its most basic, it is software to track changes in groups of files and assist with switching between versions of files. 

Hopefully you already have a GitHub account and have worked with git before. If not, please set up an account (it's free).


### What We Will Be Doing Here ###

This site is a supplement to the class Blackboard site, not a replacement for it!

I will be posting data for all assignments here: you must set up your code and results to match the directory structure here, so that I can load/grade all of your work efficiently!

If you do not have your own computer or cannot use git on your computer for any reason, please let me know immediately, via email. We will come up with a solution for submitting assignments that works for you.

Weekly quizzes/assignments must be submitted via the CUNY Blackboard site.

However, for your final projects, I intend to use GitHub for accepting and hosting your work.


### Optional Class Reading ###

There are lots of good resources on Visualization. here are quick links to books or online resources of some of the great minds in data-viz. I will be adding to this over time as I find new favorites.
