Final Project Files:

Shiny ui.R and server.R:- They show Demographical analysis of Members vs Defaulters

.Rmd and .html:- .html is an output of .rmd file. .rmd takes a little longer to load due to a loop for the percentage of payment to bill analysis.

Adjust the setwd to the file location to test this.
