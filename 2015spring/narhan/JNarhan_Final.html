<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) publishes a composite measure of achievement (the Human Development
    Index – HDI) that is based on three important dimensions associated with human development. Namely, achieving a
    decent standard of living, having access to knowledge (i.e. education and learning) and leading a long and
    healthy life.</p>

<p>This project (for <a href="http://jlaurito.github.io/CUNY_IS608/">IS608</a>) provides an interactive visualization of HDI changes over time. As the HDI measurement does not
    link explicitly to population density numbers (number of people per square kilometer), we'll investigate the
    dynamics between population density and HDI rankings over time. The latter is a relevant current issue with recent
    media reports referencing how certain countries like the Philippines may be undermining their ability to achieve
    higher economic wealth due to massive strains from population growth. The UN has also warned of heighten food
    insecurity as we edge toward a global population of 9 billion by

        others</a> debate the issue.</p>

<h1>Scatter Plot of Population Density and HDI Scores Over Time</h1>
<p>Select the year of interest:</p>

<br>
<p>The first visualization is a scatter plot of the population density (log scale) of a given country and its HDI score.
    I’ve deliberately tied the colour coding on each data point to the country’s 2013 HDI rank. This enables one to
    view how the country’s rank and population has either grown, decayed or remain stagnate. Simply select the year of
    interest to see how a country’s data has changed. A simple tooltip allows the user to identify the country with any
    given point.</p>

<h2>Some Analysis</h2>
<p>It is unlikely that population density in and of itself will factor in a significant manner for influencing HDI.
    However, this work aimed to provide some understanding of this variable’s dynamics with the HDI ratings. It may set
    the scene for more exploratory analysis with other variables in time. The exploratory analysis was performed in R
    to investigate if any relationship exists (see Methodology section for the link to the exploratory analysis).
    Some of the LOESS regression images appear to indicate that as population density increases, we can observer a
    decline in the HDI ranking until a certain point is reached. At that point it looks like HDI ranking actually
    increase before plateauing (recognize that Singapore and Hong Kong are may be viewed as outliers however).
    This trend was repeated for each specific year (note prior to 2010, the UN used a three point scale before moving to
    the current point ranking scale).</p>
<p>One may speculate that as population growth initially increases, limited resources/wealth are shared among a larger
    population implying less to go around (i.e. pressures that reduce HDI scores). At a certain point, the population
    growth may more positively influence income levels by creation of larger consumer markets, more opportunities for
    gathering greater tax revenues that support public goods (improving quality of life) et cetera, all of which may
    more positively influence the HDI scores. </p>

<h1>Map of 2013 Human Development Index Scores</h1>

<p>Given the spatial nature of the data, the D3 visualization portrays the overall HDI rankings using a map for 2013
    data. The data behind this combined UNDP HDI data and population data (see Methodology and Data Sources). A more
    intricate tool tip is provided. By placing the mouse over a given country, more information on each country is
    provided</p>

<h1>Data Sources</h1>
<p>This project uses population density figures and HDI ratings for all 187 countries that are included as part of the
    most recent (2014) UNDP HDI data. The UNDP 2014 Human Development Index dataset can be downloaded from this
    <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr14_statisticaltables.xls" target="_blank">location</a>.
</p>

<p>Population density information is not included in the HDI data set and instead was scraped from a website listing
    United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division data.
    The first web page scraped contained information on each countries land mass and 2013 population estimates.
    The web page can be found <a href="http://www.geohive.com/earth/world.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.
    The second web page scraped had important information on past population numbers that I used (namely 1980, 1990,
    2000, 2010). The page can be found <a href="http://www.geohive.com/earth/his_proj.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>Ther scatter plot and map visualizations were created used D3. Data was aquired and cleaning using Python. A link for
    the Python code used is listed here:
    <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jnarhan/DataViz/blob/master/Semester%20Project/data_munging.ipynb"
target="_blank">iPython Notebook</a></p>.
<p>The explorartory analysis was performed in R which also created a number of CSV files that were used in D3 for
the vizualization effort. A link to the code is here:
    <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jnarhan/DataViz/blob/master/Semester%20Project/Exploratory_Analysis.html"
