The Data cleaning step "Step-1-Data-Cleaning" has an RMD file, that explains the steps performed to clean the data. It also has Hospital_Charges.csv file, that is processed by the RMD file to produce two .csv files: Treatment_modified.csv and Distinct_treatments.csv files. The RMD will run for a while. To save time, I generated the two .csv files (Treatment_modified.csv and Distinct_treatments.csv) and placed in Step-2-Visualization directory.

The Step-2-Visualization directory has all the files needed to run the visualization.
