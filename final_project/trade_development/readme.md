# US Trade Development

#########

*This project will be done in conjunction with the [US Trade and Development Agency](http://www.ustda.gov/pubs/index.asp)*

## Background

The US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) is an independent U.S. Government foreign assistance agency that is funded by the U.S. Congress.

The USTDA's mission is to help companies create U.S. jobs through the export of U.S. goods and services for priority development projects in emerging economies. USTDA links U.S. businesses to export opportunities by funding project planning activities, pilot projects, and reverse trade missions while creating sustainable infrastructure and economic growth in partner countries.

The USTDA is interested in showing how the projects it has funded have changed over the last decade, both by region and my topic.

## Assignment

The USTDA is interested in a visualization that shows how the projects it has funded have changed over the last decade, both by region and my topic.

Data is now available from the USTDA [annual reports](http://www.ustda.gov/pubs/annualreport/). We are working to make all of the data available in more convenient formats.

The USTDA would like to show how its changes have mirrored changes in teh overall world economy. Pulling additional data from the [US Census](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/) or the [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG) will be encouraged.
