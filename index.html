        <h3>CUNY SPS IS 608 Final Project</h3>
        <p>As part of the <a href="http://sps.cuny.edu/programs/ms_dataanalytics">Master's Degree in Data Analytics</a> at CUNY's School of Professional Studies, students complete class IS 608, an introduction to data visualization tools. </p>
        <p>For their final project, students in IS 608 were assigned to create a public visualization using data relevant to a <em>current policy, business, or justice issue</em>. Students were encouraged to use any dataset they could find, as long as the data was either public or the student had permission from the dataâ€™s owner/administrator to work with it and share it.</p>

        <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
        <p>We were fortunate to have several great people and organizations help us create and host these visualizations. I would like to thank them here for their contributions of time and resources:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>, for granting us an <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/community/education/">Azure academic pass</a>, which is allowing us to host some of the larger projects</li>
          <li>The <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Committees/House/H32">Massachusetts House Committee on Bonding, Capital Expenditures and State Assets</a> for providing us with data on state spending by authorization</li>
          <li>The <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/">Brennan Center for Justice</a> for asking us to look at the fascinating data around the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010</li>
          <li>The <a href="http://www.ustda.gov/">US Trade and Development Agency</a> for providing data around their grant history</li>
          <li>The team at <a href="http://www.datakind.org/">DataKind</a>, in particular <a href="https://twitter.com/Pdarche">Peter Darche</a>, for speaking with us and sharing a number of data sets</li>
          <li><a href="https://twitter.com/noneck">Noel Hidalgo</a> of <a href="http://betanyc.us/">BetaNYC</a> for speaking with us about the power of open data on a local level</li>
          <li>The team running the Master's in Data Analytics program at CUNY, in particular Paul Russo and Andy Catlin, for their support for this project and all of the work we have done</li>
          <li>And finally, the students: everything you are seeing is their work, with only minor tweaks to get projects online; most of the students started the semester with little or no knowledge of visualization libraries or JavaScript and I could not be prouder of the progress they made this semester</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thank you for your interest in our class's work.
